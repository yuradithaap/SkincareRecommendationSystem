<h1>✨ Skincare Recommendation System ✨</h1>
This skincare recommendation system uses a user-based collaborative filtering method where products are recommended based on the preferences of other users. To determine the closest users, it is calculated using the Pearson correlation algorithm and to determine the products to be recommended using the weighted sum algorithm.
